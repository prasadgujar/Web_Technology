          <p>FIFA World Cup can be counted as one of the world’s biggest and most followed sporting event.In 1930 , the first ever fifa world cup was held in Uruguay . the hosts were the winners who defeated their South American opponents argentina and managed to score 4 goals and emerged victorious in front of a 93,000 strong crowd. This victory was like a cherry on the top to the already going 100th Independence year celebrations
</p>

          <p>The World cup is a competition contested by the senior men’s national teams of the members of FIFA. The event is held after every four years and Germany are the current champions after their stunning display at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.</p>

<p>Of all the countries, who participated in the fierce 3 year selection matches , 32 teams play the in the main event which is held every 4 years.Brazil,Uruguay,Argentina,Italy,France,England,Spain,Germany are the only  nations , who have won the world cup which has been organized 20 times so far.</P>

<p>Since , it is one of the world’s largest sporting event , FIFA world cup has a huge number of followers and viewers around the globe which makes it more famous than the Olympic Games. As a matter of fact, the world cup finals , held in Germany was viewed by over 715.1 million viewers all over the world.</p>

<p>The tournament’s qualification phase is played around the world for a period of three years; this phase determines the teams that are eligible to enter the month-long showpiece event, which is also known as the ‘World Cup finals’.</p>
 
<p>The host of this elite competition automatically receives qualification in the tournament and is among the 32 teams competing against each other for over a month. Brazil are the only nation to have played in every tournament. </p>
 
<p>Brazil are considered to be football’s greatest nation, and not without reason – they have won this prestigious tournament as many as five times. The last time Brazil caught hold of this famous trophy was back in the 2002 World Cup in Korea/Japan where Ronaldo inspired them to a 2-0 victory over Germany in the final. Ronaldo also ended the tournament as the top scorer with eight goals. Prior to that triumph, Brazil had won the competition back in 1958, 1962, 1970 and 1994.</p>

<p>Germany and Italy are the competition’s second most successful teams; both have won the tournament four times. The last time Italy won the World Cup was in 2006, when they defeated France in the final. Italy’s victory, however, was overshadowed by Zinedine Zidane’s infamous headbutt on Marco Materazzi.
The two South American countries Argentina and Uruguay have won the tournament twice each. Argentina’s 1986 World Cup triumph was inspired by captain Diego Maradona who scored the “Hand Of God” goal, coupled with his incredible solo goal against England in the tournament semifinal. The latter goal was voted as the “best goal of the century”.</p>

</p>The three European nations England, France and Spain have all won the World Cup once. Zidane was the star player in World Cup 1998 which was held in France; the hosts went on to defeat the former champions Brazil in the final by three goals.England won their first (and only) World Cup in 1996, while Spain won it in 2010, two years after they won the Euro 2008.
